              Imagination Library has partnered with the American Printing House
              for the Blind, Inc (APH) to provide many of the books in the
              program in braille and audio format, making them accessible to
              young children who are blind or visually impaired. Additionally,
              her businesses have not only created jobs but also brought

            <p>
              She represents hard work, never giving up, and being kind. Her
              story of going from poor to successful in the entertainment world
              is inspiring. Even with all her fame, she stays humble and real.
              Like with the Imagination Library, her kindness shows how caring
              she is. I respect how she stays genuine while reaching big goals.
